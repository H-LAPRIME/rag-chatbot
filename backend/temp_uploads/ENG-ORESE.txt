"Our greatest accomplishments cannot be measured by what we build, but by who we become while building them". A powerful quote from the movie Interstellar reminds us that progress is not just about innovation and technology, but, most importantly, about ethics and values.

If we want to build a great future, we should not only focus on the future itself, but it is better to focus on the builders of that future. These builders are you, me, and everyone in the world.

Imagine two nuclear scientists. One is guided by ethics and conscience—someone who cares about other human beings, animals, and the environment. The other is driven by capitalist thinking, concerned only with money, fame, and power. The ethical scientist will create medicines, clean energy sources, and other advances that bring hope and progress to the world. The other will develop weapons—a nuclear bomb that kills millions and poses a threat of destruction to the world.

Believe me when I say that ethics are the cornerstone for building a prosperous future—a future where everyone lives in peace on their land and with their family. A future where innovations and industries are built with pure intentions and meaningful goals. A future where there are no killers or terrorists harming and killing innocent women and children in front of the whole world without shame or mercy.

A future where people cooperate and work hard to create a better life for all—without racism, greed, or discrimination of any kind.

I know it is hard to achieve this kind of future, perhaps even impossible. But if each one of us does our best to make a positive change, no matter how small, we can make remarkable progress.

As future engineers, we are all responsible for creating, inventing, solving problems, and pushing humanity forward.

As examples of projects I personally hope to create or see others developing them such innovations like a very smart AI-assisted glass for blind people, which would act as a descriptive eye that analyzes and describes everything in its view to the person wearing it. This invention could help them greatly, reducing their struggles and feelings of loneliness. Another idea is to create smart, reliable drones that can deliver aid and provide help to people anywhere on the planet. Such technology could assist in emergencies, reach those in remote or dangerous areas, and, in some cases, even save lives.

Let’s build a future—a kind of future where our hearts and morals guide our actions. A future where we become flames that light, not flames that burn.

We do what we have to do so that others can do what they want to do.
